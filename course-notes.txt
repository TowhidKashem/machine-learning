data set -> fed into algoritm -> produces model that makes predictions


features = variables that affect a certain outcome
label = the outcome


2 types of problems:
  - classification
  - regression


Algoritms:
  - K-nearest neighbor (knn) - birds of a feather flock together



Transfer learning - the act of taking an existing model (often referred to as a base model) and using it on a similar but different data set
  - it's much faster/easier to train a model than like this than to start from scratch
  - many of the original learnings of the model will carry over to the new info


- mobilenet is much smaller (17MB) than other base models (VGG16 - 553MB) but the reduced accuracy difference is negligible
  - other models are huge due to the many weight parameters (VGG16 - 138 million) vs mobilenet (4.2 million)
  - the large file size on disk also means greater memory allocation needed to load the huge models
  - mobilenet and VGG16 were both trained on the imagenet library
  - mobilenet expects training images that are 224x224

tensorflow.js has performance parity with tensorflow python
