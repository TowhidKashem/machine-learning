data set -> fed into algoritm -> produces model that makes predictions


features = variables that affect a certain outcome
label = the outcome


2 types of problems:
  - classification
  - regression


Algoritms:
  - K-nearest neighbor (knn) - birds of a feather flock together



Transfer learning - the act of taking an existing model (often referred to as a base model), and using it on a similar but different domain
  - is much faster/easier to train a model than if started from scratch
