data set -> fed into algoritm -> produces model that makes predictions


features = variables that affect a certain outcome
label = the outcome


2 types of problems:
  - classification
  - regression


Algoritms:
  - K-nearest neighbor (knn) - birds of a feather flock together



Transfer learning - the act of taking an existing model (often referred to as a base model) and using it on a similar but different data set
  - it's much faster/easier to train a model than like this than to start from scratch
  - many of the original learnings of the model will carry over to the new info



- mobilenet is much smaller (17MB) than other base models (VGG16 - 553MB) but the reduced accuracy difference is negligible
  - other models are huge due to the many weight parameters (VGG16 - 138 million) vs mobilenet (4.2 million)
  - the large file size on disk also means greater memory allocation needed to load the huge models
  - mobilenet and VGG16 were both trained on the imagenet library
  - mobilenet expects training images that are 224x224

Supervised vs Unsupervised learning:

   - Supervised learning: u have a data set and a list of outcomes, the outcomes determine whether you have a classification or a regression type problem


---------------------------------------------------

Regression vs Classification problems:

regression problem outcome values are always numbers, continous vaues (1 - 100, could be $1 or $45.20)
  e.g. what will be the average home prices this year?
       how many t-shirts should I produce for my inventory?

classification problem outcome values are classes aka categories, discreet values (yes or no, true or false, cat or dog, etc)
  e.g. what is this an image of?
       is this person likely to default on their loan?

Deep Learning - a subfield of machine learning where the algorithms are inspired by the structure of the human brain

Nueral Networks - take in data -> train themselves to recognize the patterns in this data -> predict the output for a new set of similar data

Libraries:

  tensorflow is a low level lib, ml5 is a wrapper around tensorflow which also includes various pre-trained models and it makes using tensorflow easier

  keras is a higher level lib built on top of tensorflow, although it uses tensorflow on the backend it's easier to build nueral networks through keras than directly with tensorflow

  just as Keras is built on top of Tensorflow ml5.js is built on top of Tensorflow.js. It is a high-level library that makes it easier to program neural networks in the browser. With ml5.js you can even gain access to pre-trained models that you can easily load and train

  tensorflow.js has performance parity with tensorflow python


---------------------------------------------------

Pre-trained models:

  CocoSSD 
    - based on the COCO dataset (common objects in context) - https://cocodataset.org
    - only detects 80 classes of objects
    - object detection and prediction model. This model is able to identify different objects in one image, and come up with a prediction for each of those objects. CocoSSD uses a dataset called Coco, which has labels of 80 different object classes


  YOLO

Deep learning algorithms for image classification / recognition:

  - AlexNet
  - GoogleNet
  - MobileNet
  - VGGNet

Famous dataset for image classification:

  - ImageNet (1,000 classes)
