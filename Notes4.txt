Split data into 3 sets:

  1. Training set   - this is the course material
  2. Validation set - this is the practise quiz
  3. Test set       - this is the final exam

End to end process for making an image classification model in Tensorflow:

  Step 1 - Data exploration
            - check out the images and labels
              - how many total images are there?
              - how many total labels are there?
              - how many images per label on average?
              - do the number of images match the number of labels?

  Step 2 - Data preperation
            - crop the images to 224x224 pixels
            - convert labels and images into numpy arrays
            - create functions for converting label and image numpy arrays into tensors
            - create functions for grouping label and image tensors into batches (32 image/label tensor pairs per batch)
            - split data into TRAINING, VALIDATION and TESTING sets

Keras sequential vs functional apis

While a model is training it's LOSS should go down and it's ACCURACY should go up

Overfitting = when a model performs better on the training data set than on the validation data set

Overfitting as the BEGINNING is a good thing, it means the model is learning
