Split data into 3 sets:
  1. Training set - this is the course material
  2. Validation set - this is the practise quiz
  3. Test set - this is the final exam


Google Colab:
  If you want to use a large dataset in Google Colab you should use `tf.data.Dataset` for preparing it before training to avoid hitting limits.
  If you want to use GPUs you can use any TF version. But for TPU I would recommend using TF1.14.
