1. Traditional Machine Learning
  - is more manual
  - the engineer does feature extraction and tries to find patterns in the data before feeding it into the model
  - then the model does the classification or regression work
  - example lib: scikit learn


2. Deep Learning
  - the machine does both feature extraction and regression/classification work
  - example lib: tensorflow / keras

------

Model
  - simply a function that the computer writes (instead of the engineer) to do some work
  - to come up with the model we give the computer some input and labeled output (to check it's answers)


2 types of models/problems:
  - classification e.g. detect the dog breed
  - regression e.g. predict housing prices for the next year


sample = row in a table

hyper parameters
  - little knobs on the model that can be tweaked and dialed to get better results
  - this process is known as parameter optimization
