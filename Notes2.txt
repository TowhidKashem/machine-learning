Variance = measure of the average degree to which each number is different from the mean

Higher Variance = wider range of numbers
Lower Variance = lower range of numbers

> numpy.var(<np_array>)

Standard Deviation = measure of how spread out a group of numbers is from the mean
  - The SQ Root = Standard Deviation

> numpy.std(<np_array>)

Real-world example:

  To detect trees in images:
    - we take an image and use the `matplotlib.image.imread()` method to load it as a numpy array
    - this multidimensional array stores numeric values at each index which represents the RGB (red, green, blue) values of each pixel
    - by analyzing 2 images and checking the *** VARIANCE *** of each array segment we can find similar images
    - if 2 segments have a *** LOW VARIANCE *** then they must be of the same thing e.g. trees



Numpy:
  - makes working with arrays and matrices easy and efficient (numpy array methods are much faster than standard python methods)
  - pandas, matplotlib and scikitlearn all use numpy as a dependency
  - the central data structure in numpy is the ndarray (N-Dimensional Array). Named for supporting any number (n) of dimensions
  - dealing with a new dimension is just adding a comma to the parameters of a numpy function


----------

1. Pandas (dataframes):
  - create graphs from dataframes:

      car_dealership = pd.DataFrame({
        'models': pd.Series(['Honda', 'Toyota', 'Mercedes']),
        'colors': pd.Series(['red', 'blue', 'green'])
      })

- columns of the graph are the `keys` of the dataframe and the rows are series `values`
  - dataframes = dictionaries
  - series = lists
- create dataframes by loading csv files `pd.read_csv(...)`


2. Numpy = (ndarrays / matrices):
  - run mathematical operations between different numbers in a matrix
  - data comparison and analysis
  - find the standard deviation/variance/mean/sum etc
  - load an image into a ndarray
    - each pixel is a value in the ndarray containing a numeric value for the RGB contents of the pixel
    - check for patterns against other images to find similar items e.g. trees


3. Matplotlib (data visualization):
  - create graphs
